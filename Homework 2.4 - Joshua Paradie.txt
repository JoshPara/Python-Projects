# Joshua Paradie - Homework 2.4 - Distance Traveled
# This program will run calculations for the distance a car travels down the interstate
# after 6 hours, after 10 hours, and after 15 hours. The program will use the calculation
# distance = speed x time. Speed for this program is a constant of 70 miles per hour.
# There will be no user input on this program since it is just a program to calculate and
# display the distance the car will travel

print("\nDistance Traveled Calculations: \n-------------------------------")
time_6_hours = 70 * 6
time_10_hours = 70 * 10
time_15_hours = 70 * 15
# The 3 calculations above are to calculate the distance the car will drive after 6, 10, and 15 Hours
