# Joshua Paradie - Homework 4.3 - Budget Analysis - 2/15/2022
# This program will have the user enter their budget for the month, the program will then have the user enter an expense
# and then ask them if they would like to enter another expense. The program will loop until the user choose not to
# enter another expense, at that point the program will calculate whether the total expenses entered is over, under, or
# exactly the entered budget and will tell them how much over or under they were.

print("Budget Analysis Program \n-----------------------")
budget_for_the_month = float(input("Enter Your Budget For The Month: $"))
# Has the user enter their budget and saves it in a float

reentry = 'y'

while (reentry == 'y') or (reentry == 'Y') or (reentry == 'yes') or (reentry == 'YES') or (reentry == 'Yes'):
    input_amount = float(input("Enter The Amount For The Expense: $"))
    running_expense_total = running_expense_total + input_amount
    reentry = input("Do You Wish To Enter Another Expense? \n(Enter 'Y' For Yes... Enter 'N' For No...): ")
    print()
# The above code is a loop, user enters their expense and the program adds it to the running expense total and then if
# the user wants to enter another expense the program will loop and allow for the user to enter as many expenses as they
# desire.

over_under_budget = budget_for_the_month - running_expense_total
# Calculates the expense total compared to the budget

if running_expense_total < budget_for_the_month:
    print("You Are Under Budget! You Have", over_under_budget, "Dollars Remaining In Your Budget For The Month!")
# If expense total is less than budget

elif running_expense_total > budget_for_the_month:
