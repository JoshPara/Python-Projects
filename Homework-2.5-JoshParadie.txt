# Joshua Paradie - Homework 2.5 - Sales Tax
# This program will take the user input for amount of a purchase and from that amount
# calculate the sales tax (5 Percent) and calculate the county sales tax (2.5 percent).
# The program will then display the purchase amount, the state sales tax, the county sales
# tax, the total sales tax, and the total of the sale.

total_purchase_price = float(input("Enter The Total Amount Of The Purchase: $"))

county_tax = total_purchase_price * 0.025
total_sales_tax = state_tax + county_tax

# Above are the 4 calculations to determine sales tax, county tax, total sales tax, and total
# of the entire sale
