Hello Professor!



In this zip file it contains my final project for Python (6651-01) as well as a test file of number you are free to use as well.


The encryption/decryption key which the program will prompt you to enter when you want to decrypt or encrypt the data is:  Josh_Gets_A_100


The program is very large, I was trying to account for a wide variety of exceptions and events, however there may be some I overlooked 
(I don’t think so but it’s a possibility). If you have any questions or if forever reason the program isn’t running like it’s supposed 
to please reach out to me and let me know. Thank you so much!



Very Respectfully,
Joshua Paradie
