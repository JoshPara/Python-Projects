print("Cookie Recipe \n-------------")

# Above is for the user to input the amount of cookies they would like to make
amount_of_sugar = (1.5 / 48) * number_of_cookies
amount_of_butter = (1.0 / 48.0) * number_of_cookies
amount_of_flour = (2.75 / 48.0) * number_of_cookies
# The above code is to determine how much of each ingredient the user will need to make the inputted number of cookies.
# The math done here is to divide the amount of each ingredient on the recipe by 48 cookies since that's what the
# recipe card makes to find out the ingredients needed per cookie and then multipy it by the number of inputted cookies.
