# Joshua Paradie - Homework 4.4 - Calculating The Factorial of a Number - 02/15/2022
# This program has the user enter a non-negative integer and the program uses a loop to calculate the factorial of that
# user entered number and displays the factorial.

print("Calculating The Factorial Of A Number \n-------------------------------------")
user_entered_number = int(input("Enter A Non-Negative integer: "))
# Has the user enter a non-negative integer to find the factorial of.

count = user_entered_number
factorial_number = user_entered_number
# Sets count to the entered number along with the factorial number so that the looping equation will calculate correctly

while count != 1:
    count = count - 1
# Loops down till count is decreased to 1
    factorial_number = factorial_number * count

print("The Factorial Of", user_entered_number, "is", factorial_number)
