# Joshua Paradie - Homework 5.5 - Random number guessing game - 2/22/22
# This program will generate a random number in the range of 1 to 100. The program will then ask the user to input a
# guess of what they think the number is. The program will either tell the user their guess is too high, too low, or
# that they got it correct. If the guess is too high or too low the program will allow the user to keep guessing until
# they guess correctly. When the user guesses correctly the program will tell the user how many tries it took them to
# guess the number and then the program will generate another random number and repeat the game.
