# Joshua Paradie - Homework 5.4 - Future Value - 2/22/22
# This program will take the three inputs from a user, pass them to a function, which will then use those values in an
# equation to compute the future value of the users' money. The function will then pass back that value to main and the
# program will print the future value of the users' money.

def future_money_value(present_value, interest_rate, total_months):
    future_value_of_account = present_value * (1.0 + interest_rate) ** total_months
    return future_value_of_account
# The above function takes the user inputted values and puts it in an equation to determine future value, returning that
# future value to main.


print("\nFuture Value \n------------")
accounts_present_value = float(input("Enter The Accounts Present Value: $"))
monthly_interest_rate = float(input("Enter The Current Monthly Interest Rate As A Decimal: "))
number_of_months = float(input("Enter The Number Of Months The Money Will Be Left In The Account: "))
# The above code are 3 user inputs, saved as float values.

future_money_value(accounts_present_value, monthly_interest_rate, number_of_months)
# The above code calls the function, passing the variable values that the user entered.

print(f"The Future Value Of Your Money After {number_of_months} Months Is $", end='')
print(future_money_value(accounts_present_value, monthly_interest_rate, number_of_months))
# The above code prints the future value of the users' money by using the amount returned to main from the function.
