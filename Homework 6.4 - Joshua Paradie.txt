# Joshua Paradie - Homework 6.4 - Average of Numbers - 03/22/2022
# This program will take a file named 'numbers.txt' that exists on the computers' disk. The program will then read all
# the numbers stored in that file, calculate the total of the numbers on the file, count how many numbers are on the
# file and divide the total of the numbers by the amount of number to get the average of the numbers.

def main():
    print('Average Of Numbers \n------------------')
    total = 0
    number_counter = 0
# Creates a main function, prints a title, creates a total counter and a number counter setting both to 0

    for line in open_numbers_file():
        line = int(line)
        total = line + total
        number_counter = number_counter + 1
    # The above code takes the open_numbers_file function, converts each str line to an int, goes line by line adding
    # the number from each line to the total sum counter as well as counting how many numbers are in the file.

    average_of_numbers = total / number_counter
    print(f'The Sum Of The Numbers In numbers.txt File Is: {average_of_numbers}')
    # The above code determines the average of the numbers by taking the sum of the numbers and dividing it by how many
    # numbers are in the file to determine the average, then it prints the average of all the numbers in the numbers.txt
    # file.


def open_numbers_file():
    numbers = open('numbers.txt', 'r')
    content_of_file = numbers.read()
    numbers.close()
# Above code opens numbers.txt in read only, reads and saves the contents and then closes the file.

    content_of_file = content_of_file.split('\n')
    return content_of_file
    # The above code splits the saved info by the '\n' character and returns the contents of the file.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
# The above code calls in main
