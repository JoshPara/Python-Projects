# Joshua Paradie - Homework 6.3 - Sum of Numbers - 03/22/2022
# This program will take a file named 'numbers.txt' that exists on the computers' disk. The program will then read all
# the numbers stored in that file and calculate the total of the numbers

def main():
    print('Sum Of Numbers \n--------------')
    total = 0
# Creates a main function, prints a title, creates a total counter to 0

    for line in open_numbers_file():
        line = int(line)
        total = line + total
        print(line)
    # The above code takes the open_numbers_file function, converts each str line to an int, goes line by line adding
    # the number from each line to the total sum counter and prints the line from the file.

    print(f'The Sum Of The Numbers In numbers.txt File Is: {total}')
    # Prints the total sum of all the numbers in the numbers.txt file.


def open_numbers_file():
    numbers = open('numbers.txt', 'r')
    content_of_file = numbers.read()
    numbers.close()
# Above code opens numbers.txt in read only, reads and saves the contents and then closes the file.

    content_of_file = content_of_file.split('\n')
    return content_of_file
    # The above code splits the saved info by the '\n' character and returns the contents of the file.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
# The above code calls in main
