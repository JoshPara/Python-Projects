# Joshua Paradie - Homework 2.7 - Tip, Tax, and Total Program
# This program calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant.
# The program will have the user enter the charge for the food. The program will then calculate the
# sales tax (7 Percent) and the tip (18 percent). Both of these will be calculated from the total amount of the meal
# price and has no effect on one another. The program will then display these amounts and the total bill after sales
# tax and tip are accounted for.

print("\n\t\tBill \n--------------------------")
food_charge = float(input("Enter The Charge For The Food: $"))
sales_tax = food_charge * 0.07
tip_18 = food_charge * 0.18
total_cost = food_charge + sales_tax + tip_18
# Above is the user input for food cost, along with the 3 calculations to find out sales tax, tip, and total cost
# 18% tip is based off the food charge and independent of the sales tax, and sales tax is calculated independently
# from tip
print("Charge For Food: $", food_charge)
print("Sales Tax On Food: $", sales_tax)
print("18% Tip On Food: $", tip_18)
print("--------------------------")
print("Total Cost Of Bill: $", total_cost)
# Above are the program displayed amounts for each category
