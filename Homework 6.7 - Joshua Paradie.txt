# Joshua Paradie - Homework 6.7 - Golf Scores - 03/22/2022
# This Program contains 2 programs, the first one will take as user input each player's name and golf score, save all
# the data in a filed created named 'golf.txt'. The second program will read the players and scores from 'golf.txt' and
# display them.
