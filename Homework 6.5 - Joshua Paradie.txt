# Joshua Paradie - Homework 6.5 - Random Number File Writer - 03/22/2022
# This program asks how many numbers the user wants to write to a file, it then writes a series of random numbers (the
# specified amount) to a file, the numbers being in a range of 1 through 500.

def main():
    specified_numbers = int(input('How Many Random Numbers Do You Want To Write: '))
    write_numbers_file(specified_numbers)
    print('Random Numbers Written To File')
# The above code has the user enter the amount of random numbers they want to write to a file, it calls in
# 'write_numbers_file' function and passes the specified number. At the end it prints a success message.


def write_numbers_file(numbers):
    outfile = open('random_numbers.txt', 'w')
    import random
    counter = 0
# The above code opens a new file into write mode, imports random library, and creates a counter.

    while counter < numbers:
        write_number = int(random.randint(1, 500))
        outfile.write(str(write_number) + '\n')
        counter = counter + 1
    # The above code is a loop for generating and writing a random number into the file, including converting the int to
    # a string to write into the file.

    outfile.close()
    # Closes the file


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
# The above code calls in main
