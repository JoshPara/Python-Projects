# Joshua Paradie - Homework 5.1 - Odd/Even Counter - 2/21/2022
# This program will generate 100 random numbers and keep track of how many even numbers are generated as well as how
# many odd numbers are generated.

import random
counter = 0
odd_number = 0
even_number = 0
# The above code imports "random" so that a random number can be generated. Also, it creates 3 variable, counter,
# odd_number, and even_number, all of which are used to keep a tally of different things.

print("\nOdd/Even Counter \n----------------")

while counter < 100:
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100000)
    print(random_number)
    counter = counter + 1
    if (random_number % 2) == 0:
        even_number = even_number + 1
    else:
        odd_number = odd_number + 1
    random_number = 0
# The above code is a while loop that loops 100 times, each time it generates and prints a random number between
# 1-100000, increases the counter by one, and then determines if the random number is odd or even and increases the
# count for the correct variable.

print(f"There Are {odd_number} Odd Numbers")
print(f"There Are {even_number} Even Numbers")
# The above code prints how many odd number are generated and the number of even numbers generated.
