# Joshua Paradie - Homework 3.3 - Age Classifier
# This is a program that will have the user enter a person's age and then depending on the age entered the program
# will tell the user if the person is classified as an infant, child, teenager, or an adult, depending on age entered

print("Age Classifier \n--------------")
user_Entered_Age = float(input("Enter The Age Of The Person: "))
# The above code has the user enter the age of the person
if user_Entered_Age <= 1 and user_Entered_Age >= 0:
    print("The Person Is An Infant")
elif user_Entered_Age > 1 and user_Entered_Age < 13:
    print("The Person Is A Child")
elif user_Entered_Age >= 13 and user_Entered_Age < 20:
    print("The Person Is A Teenager")
elif user_Entered_Age >= 20:
    print("The Person Is An Adult")
# The above code determines which age to classify the person at depending on the user entered age
else:
    print("Invalid Age... Age Cannot Be Less Than 0...")
# The above code makes sure the age entered is a valid age of a person. A person can't be less than 0 years old
