# Joshua Paradie - Homework 6.2 - Item Counter - 03/05/2022
# This is a program that will take a file named names.txt from the computers' disk. It will then display the number of
# names that are on the file.

def main():
    print("Item Counter \n------------")
    count = 0
    for line in open_name_file():
        count = count + 1
        print(line)
    print(f"There Are {count} Names In The File.")
# The above code creates a counter, brings in 'open_name_file', goes line by line printing the names in the file and
# increasing the counter by 1 each time. After all the lines have been gone through, the program displays the number of
# names in the file.


def open_name_file():
    in_file = open("names.txt", "r")
    contents_of_file = in_file.read()
    in_file.close()
    contents_of_file = contents_of_file.split("\n")
    return contents_of_file
# The above code opens the 'names.txt' file in read mode, reads the contents of the file, saves and closes the file. It
# then splits the contents of the file by the '\n' character and returns the contents to main.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
# The above code calls in main
